# Impeller

Impeller is a rotor used to increase (or decrease in case of turbines) the pressure and flow of a fluid.

It is also a thin Cython wrapper around modified [fork](https://github.com/m9psy/libxlsxwriter) of [libxlsxwriter](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter), partially compatible with [Python XlsxWriter](https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter).

TODO: Link to benchmark.py, benchmark.c, comparing Cython, C and modified C versions
The only difference is speed:
TODO: Benchmarks here

Current status: not usable at all, work in progress.
